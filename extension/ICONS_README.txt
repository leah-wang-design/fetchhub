ICON PLACEHOLDER FILES NEEDED

The extension requires 3 icon files. You can create these using any image editor:

Required Files:
- icon16.png  (16x16 pixels)  - Toolbar icon
- icon48.png  (48x48 pixels)  - Extension management page
- icon128.png (128x128 pixels) - Chrome Web Store

Temporary Solution:
For testing, you can use simple colored squares or download free icons from:
- https://www.flaticon.com/
- https://icons8.com/
- https://iconmonstr.com/

Design Suggestion:
- Pink/blue gradient background
- White camera icon (📸) or comment bubble
- Simple, recognizable design

Quick Creation (macOS):
1. Open Preview
2. File → New from Clipboard
3. Tools → Adjust Size (set to 16x16, 48x48, or 128x128)
4. Export as PNG with appropriate name

Until icons are added, the extension will use default Chrome icon.
